# Web3 Parduscuk Substrate Contract ink! Based Get/Flip DApp - README

Welcome to the **Web3 Parduscuk DApp** project repository! ink! is a programming language for smart contracts; blockchains built with the Substrate framework can choose from a number of smart contract languages which one(s) they want to support. ink! is one of them. It is an opinionated language that we have built by extending the popular Rust programming language with functionality needed to make it smart contract compatible.

## Overview

The **Web3 Parduscuk DApp** provides a user-friendly interface to participate in ink!-based application. ink! is an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) that you can use to write WebAssembly based smart contracts in the Rust programming language.

ink! is just standard Rust in a well defined "contract format" with specialized `#[ink(â€¦)]` attribute macros. These attribute macros tell ink! what the different parts of your Rust smart contract represent, and ultimately allow ink! to do all the magic needed to create Substrate compatible Wasm bytecode!

## Features

- "Parduscuk" is the simplest "smart" contract you can run.

- The Parduscuk contract is nothing more than a bool which gets flipped from true to false through the `flip()` function.
